# Whisper Integration Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the client-side Whisper integration for the Ghana Parliamentary Hub AI Assistant. The implementation provides high-quality speech-to-text transcription directly in the browser without requiring server-side processing.

## Features

- **Client-Side Processing**: All audio transcription happens locally in the browser
- **Privacy-First**: Audio data never leaves the user's device
- **High Accuracy**: Uses OpenAI's Whisper model for superior transcription quality
- **Real-Time Audio Monitoring**: Visual feedback with audio level indicators
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful degradation to Web Speech API when Whisper is unavailable
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Works across modern browsers with appropriate fallbacks

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **WhisperService** (`/app/lib/whisperService.ts`)
   - Manages Whisper model initialization and transcription
   - Handles audio preprocessing and format conversion
   - Provides singleton pattern for resource management

2. **AudioProcessor** (`/app/lib/audioProcessor.ts`)
   - Handles audio capture and monitoring
   - Provides real-time audio level feedback
   - Manages audio format conversion and resampling

3. **AIAssistant Component** (`/app/components/AIAssistant.tsx`)
   - Integrates Whisper with the chat interface
   - Manages recording states and user interactions
   - Provides fallback to Web Speech API

## Technical Implementation

### Model Configuration

```typescript
const config: WhisperConfig = {
  model: 'Xenova/whisper-tiny.en', // Lightweight model for browser
  language: 'en',
  task: 'transcribe',
  chunk_length_s: 30,
  stride_length_s: 5,
};
```

### Audio Processing Pipeline

1. **Audio Capture**: MediaRecorder captures audio from microphone
2. **Format Conversion**: Audio is converted to the format expected by Whisper
3. **Transcription**: Whisper model processes the audio locally
4. **Response Generation**: Transcribed text is sent to the AI assistant

### Browser Support

| Browser | Whisper Support | Web Speech API | Audio Recording |
|---------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Chrome/Edge | ✅ Full Support | ✅ Full Support | ✅ Full Support |
| Safari | ✅ Full Support | ✅ Full Support | ✅ Full Support |
| Firefox | ✅ Full Support | ❌ Not Available | ✅ Full Support |
| Mobile Chrome | ✅ Full Support | ✅ Full Support | ✅ Full Support |
| Mobile Safari | ✅ Full Support | ✅ Full Support | ✅ Full Support |

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// Initialize Whisper service
const whisperService = WhisperService.getInstance();
await whisperService.initialize();

// Transcribe audio
const result = await whisperService.transcribe(audioBlob);
console.log(result.text);
```

### Audio Processing

```typescript
// Initialize audio processor
const audioProcessor = AudioProcessor.getInstance();
await audioProcessor.initialize();

// Start monitoring audio levels
const stream = await audioProcessor.startAudioMonitoring((level) => {
  console.log('Audio level:', level.level, 'Active:', level.isActive);
});

// Process audio for Whisper
const audioData = await audioProcessor.processAudioForWhisper(audioBlob);
```

## Performance Considerations

### Model Size
- Uses `whisper-tiny.en` model (~39MB) for optimal browser performance
- Model is cached after first load for faster subsequent initializations

### Memory Management
- Automatic cleanup of audio contexts and streams
- Proper disposal of resources on component unmount
- Efficient audio processing with minimal memory footprint

### Network Usage
- Initial model download required (one-time)
- No network requests during transcription
- Offline capability after model is loaded

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
1. **Whisper Unavailable**: Falls back to Web Speech API
2. **Web Speech Unavailable**: Falls back to basic audio recording
3. **No Audio Support**: Disables voice features with clear messaging

### Error Types
- **Initialization Errors**: Model loading failures
- **Transcription Errors**: Audio processing failures
- **Permission Errors**: Microphone access denied
- **Network Errors**: Model download failures

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- All audio processing happens locally
- No audio data is transmitted to external servers
- User privacy is maintained throughout the process

### Permissions
- Requires microphone access permission
- Clear indication of when microphone is active
- Easy way to stop recording and revoke access

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model Loading Fails**
   - Check internet connection for initial download
   - Verify browser supports WebAssembly
   - Clear browser cache and retry

2. **Microphone Access Denied**
   - Check browser permissions
   - Ensure microphone is not being used by another application
   - Try refreshing the page

3. **Poor Transcription Quality**
   - Speak clearly and at normal volume
   - Reduce background noise
   - Ensure good microphone quality

### Debug Information

Enable debug logging by opening browser console. The implementation provides detailed logging for:
- Model initialization progress
- Audio processing steps
- Transcription results
- Error conditions

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Support for multiple languages
- Real-time streaming transcription
- Custom model fine-tuning
- Advanced audio preprocessing
- Batch transcription capabilities

### Performance Improvements
- WebGPU acceleration support
- Model quantization optimization
- Streaming audio processing
- Background processing with Web Workers
